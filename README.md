# n-gram-language-model
A word n-gram language model is a purely statistical model of language. It has been superseded by recurrent neural networkâ€“based models, which have been superseded by large language models. It is based on an assumption that the probability of the next word in a sequence depends only on a fixed size window of previous words.
